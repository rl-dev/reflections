How did viewig a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It saved time from having to view all of the text.


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It can help you go back in time to where the code still works if you made recent changes that are causing problems.


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

The commits are more logically defined.


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Depends on the types of files and user know-how.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

log shows all commits with ids. You can then use git diff with the ids to compare two commits.


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can always restore your file back to a previously working version.


How do you want to use Git?
